# Feed Reader Testing
In this project we have a web-based application that reads RSS feeds from various websites through Googles RSS API.</br>
The goal is to successfully make a Jasmine test spec to ensure that the code functions as intended.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development".</br> This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application.</br> All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!
